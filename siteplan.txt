1. Site Name
Entine Character Sheet Generator
This name says exactly what the site does: it’s a tool for making character sheets in the Entine world. “Character Sheet Generator” tells people the function right away, and “Entine” ties it into the bigger fantasy universe, which makes it useful for anyone into role-playing, storytelling, or world-building.

2. Site Purpose
The Entine Character Sheet Generator is made to:

Create Characters: Build fantasy character sheets with random stats, skills, and backstories.

Customize Everything: Change names, stats, skills, and background info however you want right on the page.

Save Files: Export finished sheets as JSON files for games, stories, or collections.

Support Roleplay & Writing: Quick, balanced characters for tabletop RPGs, writers, or anyone building a fantasy world.

Learn Character Building: Show how to structure characters and teach world-building through the process.

3. Scenarios

Scenario 1: Jessica (22) runs D&D for her friends every Friday. As DM, she needs a bunch of NPCs fast. She can use the generator to create diverse characters with different genders and species, then save them for the session.

Scenario 2: Marcus (17) is writing his first fantasy novel. He’s stuck on character ideas. The generator gives him a base to work with, and he can tweak the details to fit his story and save them for reference.

4. Color Scheme

Gold (#FFD700): For text, titles, borders, and button text. Makes the site feel magical and easy to read.

Dark Forest Green (rgba(36,54,39,0.92)): Used as section backgrounds to give everything a mystical feel.

Dark Gradient (#232526 → #485563): Main background for depth and atmosphere.

Orange (#FFA500): Accent color for button hovers and labels.

5. Typography
